# NumpyRandom
An investigation on Numpy.Random packages

The jupyter notebook attached is an investigation on various pseudo random generators in numpy.random.RandomState class. The author is trying to understand the basics of numpy.random functions and to plot the random samples generated by each of the functions. Some simple random sampling data functions, 5 distribution functions along with permutation and shuffle functions are investigated.

The role of seed in pseudo number generation and how seed can be implemented using numpy.random is also discussed.

unexpected: I was unable to login to GMIT account for about 10 days, which was fixed by GMIT IT team last month, but created some backlogs. everything seems to be ok now. This caused a delay in starting the assignment. so no commits were made before 03/10/2018.
